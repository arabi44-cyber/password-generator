# Password Generator Documentation

Welcome to the Password Generator documentation!

This documentation provides an overview of the Password Generator project, including its features, usage, and technical details.

## Features

- Generates strong, unique passwords for secure authentication
- Allows users to customize password length and character set
- Supports multiple password generation algorithms

## Usage

### Generating a Password

To generate a password, simply run the `passwdgen.py` script and follow the prompts.

### Customizing Password Generation

You can customize the password generation process by specifying the following options:

- `--length`: Set the password length (default: 12)
- `--chars`: Set the character set (default: alphanumeric)
- `--algorithm`: Set the password generation algorithm (default: random)

## Technical Details

### Password Generation Algorithms

The Password Generator supports multiple password generation algorithms, including:

- Random: Generates a truly random password using the `secrets` module
- Hash-based: Generates a password based on a hash of the user's input

### Character Sets

The Password Generator supports multiple character sets, including:

- Alphanumeric: Includes letters (a-z, A-Z) and digits (0-9)
- Alpha: Includes only letters (a-z, A-Z)
- Numeric: Includes only digits (0-9)

### Security Considerations

The Password Generator takes security seriously and uses secure random number generation and hashing algorithms to ensure the generated passwords are strong and unique.
