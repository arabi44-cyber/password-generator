# Architecture Overview

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- **src/**: Contains the main codebase, including `passwdgen.py` and any utility modules.
- **docs/**: Documentation files, including this architecture overview.
- **tests/**: Unit tests and test utilities.

## Core Components

### 1. `passwdgen.py`

- **Description**: The main script responsible for password generation. It handles user input for password length and character sets, then generates and outputs a random password.
- **Functionality**:
  - Accepts user-defined parameters via command-line arguments.
  - Utilizes various character sets (alphabets, digits, special characters) based on user preferences.
  - Outputs the generated password directly to the terminal.

### 2. Key Modules

#### a. Password Generation Module

- **Purpose**: Responsible for the core functionality of generating passwords based on user input.
- **Functions**:
  - Character selection from user-specified sets (e.g., alphabets, digits, special characters).
  - Assembly of the final password by combining randomly selected characters.

#### b. Input Handling

- **Purpose**: Manages command-line arguments and validates user input.
- **Functionality**:
  - Parses command-line options like password length, inclusion of digits, alphabets, and special characters.
  - Ensures input values are within acceptable ranges and formats.

#### c. Utility Functions

- **Purpose**: Provides helper functions used across the project.
- **Functions**:
  - Randomization utilities for secure password generation.
  - Character set selection functions to streamline the password creation process.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Design

- **Rationale**: The project is structured to allow for easy expansion and maintenance. Each component is designed to be independent, enabling seamless integration of new features or updates.

### 2. Randomization

- **Rationale**: Utilizes Pythonâ€™s `random` module to ensure the passwords generated are both secure and unpredictable. This approach strikes a balance between simplicity and security.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Additional Features

- **Possibilities**: Potential enhancements include adding more customization options for password generation (e.g., exclusion of similar characters, custom symbols) or improving the user interface with a GUI version.

### 2. Performance

- **Goal**: Ongoing efforts will focus on optimizing performance and reducing execution time, especially for generating very long passwords or when using complex character sets.
